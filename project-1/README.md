This folder is set up such that Notebook.ipynb works in colab if the whole folder is present on your google drive.

Using the "Mount Drive" function we imported all the right files.

In order for the code to properly run, we recommend you moving this folder to google drive and run Notebook.ipynb from colab.

We are not the authors of the EGG toolkit: we included it so we could make minor changes to it. See the readme in EGG for more info.
